 Display video using Opengl and Glut.

 This is an example program that uses the the Video 4 Linux 2
interface to read from a V4L2 device and display the results in a
window using OpenGL and the Glut and GLEW libraries.

 Notes:

* This uses the v4l2 interface. Not all video devices are v4l2; some
  are still v4l.

* The code uses the __FUNCTION__ GNU C Preprocessor macro to help make
  more informative error messages. I don't know if other compilers
  have the __FUNCTION__ macro.

* To run this program you must have OpenGL 2.0 and your graphics card
  must have at least 3 texture units.

 In my files I try to follow the pattern that foo.c has it's exported
data (functions, enums, etc) in foo.h. foo.c always includes foo.h to
make sure the header file's contents are consistent with the body of
the code. The *.frag are shader files or links to them. (The glutcam
program uses the links at runtime. If you need to change a shader
file, it's easier to change a link for a new version than to recompile
the whole program.)
